RIVER
=======

`RIVER` is an `R` package of a probabilistic modeling framework, __RIVER (RNA-Informed Variant Effect on Regulation)__ that jointly analyzes personal genome (WGS) and transcriptome data (RNA-seq) to estimate the probability that a variant has regulatory impact in that individual. It is based on a generative model assuming that genomic annotations, such as the location of a variant with respect to regulatory elements, determine the prior probability that variant is a _functional regulatory variant_, which is an unobserved variable. The functional regulatory variant status then influences whether nearby genes are likely to display outlier levels of gene expression in that person. __RIVER__ is trained in an unsupervised manner such that it does not require a labeled set of functional/non-functional variants; rather it derives its predictive power from identifying expression patterns that tend to coincide with particular rare variant annotations.

For more information about `RIVER`, check the vignettes.

For further details of a list of genomic annotations used for constructing features and how to generate the features and outlier status, please refer to our [submitted publication](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/09/09/074443).
